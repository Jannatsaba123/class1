    <b>W</b>ith the month of Ramadan in full swing, it's getting around the time when we start venturing out of our homes for iftar. Don't get me wrong, though. Iftar at home, with your family, always makes for a special evening. However, an occasional outing to a restaurant for iftar can be quite refreshing, too.
 </p>
 <p>
    Now, there are a great many restaurants in and around Dhaka that have ongoing iftar offers, but a great place to start would be to look at offers specified by your banks and mobile financial service (MFS) providers.

    <p>For example, Mastercard has a Buy One Get One (BOGO) iftar offer with Smoke Music Cafe and Golden Tulip â€“ The Grandmark Dhaka. Additionally, they are offering a BOGO sehri offer at Tastebud Gulshan.</p>
